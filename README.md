# Maze-Game
The Maze Game is a console-based game where the player navigates through a 2D maze using keyboard controls. The maze consists of open paths and walls, and the player's objective is to reach the end of the maze. The player starts at the top-left corner and must move through the maze to the bottom-right corner, avoiding walls. The player moves by entering commands (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`), representing movement up, left, down, and right, respectively.

The game uses various data structures and a loop to take user input, update the player's position, check for valid moves, and print the current state of the maze. The game continues until the player reaches the goal.
